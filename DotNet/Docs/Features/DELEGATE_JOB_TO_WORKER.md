# Delegate job to worker (api Feature)
This file explains what to use the the delegate job to worker feature in your V3 project.

## Prerequisite

### Knowledge to have:
* [Hangfire](https://www.hangfire.io/)
* JobMonitor Project

### Database:
* The hangfire database is generaly initialised by the JobMonitor project
* The connection string to this database is configured in the bianetconfig.[Env].json files (see Activation chapter)

## Overview
* When a controller is called it can create a task that is run asynchronously on the worker service server.
* It is a smart way to not slow the front server, when the task is long.
* It can be use to treat huge file or do complexe calculation.

## Activation
* bianetconfig.json
In the BIANet Section add:
```Json
    "ApiFeatures": {
      "DelegateJobToWorker": {
        "Activate": true,
        "ConnectionStringName": "[YourAppConnectionStringName]"
      }
    },
```

replace **[YourAppConnectionStringName]** by the name of your connection string in appsettings.json

## Usage
### Create the job
In the Application layer (this layer is share with the worker service) create the job classe in the Job folder.
Example form BIADemo:
```CSharp
namespace TheBIADevCompany.BIADemo.Application.Job
{
    using System;
    using BIA.Net.Core.Application.Helpers;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

    /// <summary>
    /// Sample class to use a hangfire task.
    /// </summary>
    [BIAQueueAttribute]
    public class BiaDemoTestHangfire
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="BiaDemoTestHangfire"/> class.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="configuration">The configuration.</param>
        /// <param name="logger">logger.</param>
        public BiaDemoTestHangfire(IConfiguration configuration, ILogger<BiaDemoTestHangfire> logger)
        {
            this.Configuration = configuration;
            this.Logger = logger;
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// application Configuration.
        /// </summary>
        protected IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        /// <summary>
        /// application logger.
        /// </summary>
        protected ILogger Logger { get; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Run the processes that are waiting.
        /// </summary>
        public void RunWaitingProcess()
        {
            this.Logger.LogInformation($"{DateTime.Now.ToString("dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss")}: BiaDemoTestHangfire => This log is generated by a hangfire task");
        }
    }
} 
```

### Call the job
In the Presentation.Api layer add the package Hangfire 1.7.18 (repect the version to keep a database compatibility)

You can call the job like that from a controller:
```CSharp
    using BIA.Net.Core.Application.Helpers;
    ...
    using Hangfire;
    using Hangfire.States;

    ...

    var client = new BackgroundJobClient();
    client.Create<BiaDemoTestHangfire>(x => x.RunWaitingProcess(), new EnqueuedState(BIAQueueAttribute.QueueName));
```
